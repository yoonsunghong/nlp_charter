This repo contains scripts used in generating the Doc2Vec models (DMM, DBOW) as well as the concatenated model of DMM and DBOW.  
Data files themselves are not included in this repo as the data sizes are too big.  
See doc2vec.py for the main part of the analysis/modeling/cleaning.  
utils.py and helper_func.py contain helper functions.
